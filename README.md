# "Easy breathing" for NAO robot[v.1.0]
*Attention: this project is only available in German!*<br>

### About

EasyBreathing is a simple and short guided breathing exercise, which is useful for short breaks during a lesson <br>
or a learn session or for beginning/ ending said lessons. The exercise is supposed to help do destress and refocus <br>
by helping the participants to breathe in a stable rhythm. NAO supports this rhythm with a sound, that signals when to breathe in and out.

### How the program works

After a short introduction, the user is asked to choose between one, three or five minutes of the same exercise. <br>
After that NAO gives a command to press one of his foot bumpers to start the exercise. <br>
NAO signals the participants to breathe in and the accompanying sound begins. 

### What do you need?

You will only need your NAO robot.

### Plans of further development:

We currently have no plans to further develop the program.
